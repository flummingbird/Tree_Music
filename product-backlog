PLAN
====

Python to write meta language for lillypond
emacs to write
manifesto related to my livecoding and performance art.
and this my first delving into anything close to notated music...

string manipulation, and auto formating within emacs via lisp
#good for gibber, lillypond, perhaps processing, even supercollider.

These are to be my languages for this project: python, lisp, lillypond, supercollider, and gibber.

All are free. Please feel free to do your own thing and plan your own project. I learn a lot by googling, so please steal any good ideas I have, unless you really think the're worth money.
