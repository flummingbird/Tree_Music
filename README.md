Working on data trees is something I do at work in the LSU Library. I'm looking to grow my chops there as a programmer, and I have an extensive background as a saxophonist. I'm going to be working with a few languages to build my chops.

Ultimately I'd like to use this to compose some music. Feel free to try it out.

Lillypad seems like an Ideal place to start. I should use python to do the creation of the files within lillypad. 

I'd like to use emacs.
