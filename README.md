This is the project I want to do for my dissertation. It's a synthesis of thinking about computers, both biological and quantum, silicone, and carbon.

Trees are essential in our ecology, as land dwelling primates, living in structures that at least in living memory used to be made of of them.

Trees are also structures on their own, as well as structures we can build.

Trees have a palindromic structure if you consider the roots. In computer science trees are an abstract data type that simulates hierarchical structures.

# as an anarchist I oppose, and am inherently suspicious of hierarchies.
# as a musician, it is hard to deny their power in organizing ensembles.
# I am not certain I am good at much of anything else, so I'll leave that there.

A tree can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, begining at a root. Music can also be defined in similar ways depending on the music's style and genre (these are loaded terms...)

Recursion in music is a given. Frequencies have a recursive structure to their interactive resonace. Sounds resonate inside structures and create reverb. Sounds can travel electronically, as data,
or through the atmosphere, as air or radio waves.

In order for me to try and finish the interesting parts of this document, I must do several things: discuss music that has influenced me, place myself in a context historically, analyze music
create some music, and try and make a contribution to how we think and compose about music.

#Save for biographic information...

#I am first a human person. My father plays the Bass, and the guitar and the fiddle, and has gigged in small local bands most of his life. His primary influnces are contra-dance bands, this is the

#an effect on the local people. The nature of the 'culture of mountain folks' being worthy of anything was a relatively new conc


Some musical influences that have stuck with me as a performer and a composer:

Aphex Twin
Aeosp Rock
Anthony Braxton
Carolina Chocolate Drops
Mark Applebaum
Nine Inch Nails

That's already too much to talk about.

Plenty of other artist, and even these have been written about at length by more qualified musicologists and theorists than myself.
I am seeking to place my own musical influences and their traditions, techniques, and praxis into something comprehensible.

I will need to draw on the writings of many authors:

Alan Forte
Dmitri Tymoczko
DJ Spooky
Brian Massumi
Jacques Derrida
Douglas R. Hofstadter

I probably can't include all the influences I would like. It would simply take too long.
