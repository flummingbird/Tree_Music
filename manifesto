this will be my manifesto
that language, code, art, life and earth are one.

What has happened to music. It is now all around us, yet so easy to ignore. It's become a part of the noise.

Should my music therefore be noise?

How can I reflect my culture? By looking back or looking ahead? Perhaps both are true.

Perhaps it is a liminal perspective.


Ok so that was written ages ago, it is now 2020...

Tree music will be object oriented modeling of trees, translated into music, samples, and art.

Object Orientied ontology^cite General Intelects, Wark, MacKenzie 2019


Don't do too much, stay with what I know, and learn to use opensource tools to produce simple yet complex music. Use all the tools you want, but make the product, the music, and art, the most
important result.

Write about it, think about it, give it a sturcture, and reasoning, don't be as flippant as you know you can be, but shouldn't. It may be a silly execercize for a silly degree, but it could
be worth something, at least to you, and perhaps some others.

#Some of the previous ideas about what tools we use are important.
#Currently I have opted for simpliciy over functionality, it helps me focus

#I am particualar about my tools however. The necessety of being a working
# or at least, practicing musician take a toll on the body, my hands
#become tired. Hence in graduate school I learned how to type in such a way 
# as to prevent or at least reduce fatigue in my wrists and fingers.

#Programmer dvorak has been the Ceaser Cypher for my hands, when it comes to

Getting back to the subject.

What kind of trees shall we write music about. This is simple because I love 
trees.

Oak
Cypress
Pine
Willow
Elm
Sweetgum
Persimmon
Cherry
Mesquite
Apple

What are their qualities? Their sounds, can I find them? Their shapes, and
their ecological partners? How can I base music around their principles?

I think it bears remarking how we got here, writing on a computer terminal, but also how I got here, it's probably not unlike how you got here.

My family are from east tennessee, in east tennessee something called the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned corporation moved lots of people to make room for big hydro electric damns.

These rivers feed into the mississippi and in many ways rivers and data trees are not dissimilar. But I am distracted...

This authority, like many authorities attempted to compensate the people it displaced, giving them museums, folk histories, and pbs documentaries, there is even a feature length film or two. 

Notably important films to the reigon's musical culture include: Songcatcher, a bodice ripper/musicological fantasy abouth the historic Child Ballads "Discovered" in appalachia. 

The intermingling of poor folk and their musics is notoriously exoticized by the musical academy, and often attempts to preserve fail to preserve the culture that sustains it.

#This is not unlike what is happening as louisiana continues to wash away into the gulf of mexico... perhaps that's too much gloom right up ahead...

Well my mother was contradancing with me in the womb, playing accordion, and using her loom. At some point the loom broke, and like the cracked baby grand in my grandparents house it remained,
furniture for the rest of her adult life. I hope we can fix it one day.

I own the accordion, but my fingers are a bit fat to play a "lady's accordion" according to the maker.

Dances as social exchange.

Music making is an inherently collaborative affair. Chamber music and "Combo's" being the place for collaborative music to thrive, ensemble music is, well not chamber or combo music.

Respect is required to make successful music, as well as rhythm. These principles apply equally as well in dance.

#Some notes on dance, Having grown up, and participated in contra style dance as a foundation of my own musical and dance heritage I would like to discuss the dance I encountered in school.
#Ballet and Modern Dance. Radically different forms of art co-existing in an academic environment may seem difficult, but if musicians and thesipians can do it, so to can dancers.

#Reading music and writing music, and playing music must be synonymous. They are interrellated, not separate. To that extent the tools we write with will be important. 

Tools to use
Markup languages
scripted languages
functional languages...?

To describe music in terms mathematical, and on par with current research in other fields, the editor of choice is surely something like LaTex or some other frankenstein. I cannot dedicate too
much time to recreating what those in other fields have already pionerred. So for music I think the closest thing to a writing tool is something like LillyPad. A scripted notation software. 
For sound recording, Audacity is my choice as it is open source, and easy to learn. For music processing, I like Supercollider, for many reasons. I like to build my own tools to make music, but other
creators are also excellent tool makers. Good tools are durable, not flimsy.

#This is a bit of a declaration of a musical technique, based on tools

Technique of my musical language: my answer is WIP. I am still gaining a handle on the deeply varied possibilites that exist for making and creating electroacoustic music by hand (and this includes
using computers) as computer keyboards are natually suited tools that enable the communication and work of the hands.


I will argue that from a simple number of combinations, vast complexity can arise, and that tools should be made simply in order to facilitate easy creation of deliberate sounds. Aeleatoric music
can sometimes lean towards zen, deep listening, or question the nation of what intentions are. While these may be fascinating questions, the debate still rages as to weather or not such experiments 
music ^reference Brian Fernyhough on Mark Applebaum. 

I don't really care if they are music, theatre or some sort of performance art. It doesn't matter why. It matters if I like it, and if it moves me.

We often forget the simple facts of the utilty of music in the great debates over what art should be. Music facilitates pagentry. Music is shared with one another. Music has both signal and noise in 
sythetic lattices of structure, form and a time.
