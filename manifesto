this will be my manifesto
that language, code, art, life and earth are one.

-be = 0;
be = 1;
while be, be = true;
be + 1 = we;

What has happened to music. It is now all around us, yet so easy to ignore. It's become a part of the noise.

Should my music therefore be noise?

How can I reflect my culture? By looking back or looking ahead? Perhaps both are true.

Perhaps it is a liminal perspective.


Ok so that was written ages ago, it is now 2020...

Tree music will be object oriented modeling of trees, translated into music, samples, and art.

Object Orientied ontology^cite General Intelects, Wark, MacKenzie 2019


Don't do too much, stay with what I know, and learn to use opensource tools to produce simple yet complex music. Use all the tools you want, but make the product, the music, and art, the most
important result.

Write about it, think about it, give it a sturcture, and reasoning, don't be as flippant as you know you can be, but shouldn't. It may be a silly execercize for a silly degree, but it could
be worth something, at least to you, and perhaps some others.
